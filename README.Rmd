# tuckerR.mmgg

This package performs Three-Mode Principal Components using Tuckers Models and plot interactive Biplot.Some experiment design generated three-way or three-mode data, repeated observations of a set of attributes for a set of individuals in different conditions. The information was displayed in a three-dimensional array, and the structure of the data was explored using Three-Mode Principal Component Analysis, the Tucker-2 Model.

## Installation

You can install tuckerR.mmgg from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gusart/tuckerR_mmgg")
```

## Important contribution of this package

The most important contribution of this package are the interactive biplot graphics and the application of the `diffit()` function to find the best combination of components to retain.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tuckerR.mmgg)
data(maize_pop)
output <- tucker2R(maize_pop,amb=2,stand=TRUE,nc1=3,nc2=3)
```
