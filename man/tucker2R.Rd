\title{Three-Mode Principal Components: Tucker 2 Model
}
\description{This function performs Three-Mode Principal Components  using Tucker-2 Model. Compute all the output necessary to plot  interactive  Biplot. The Three-Mode Principal Component Analysis, provides both useful analytic and graphic tools to study and characterize phytogenetic resources, especially when the influence of environmental factors are possible.
}
\usage{
tucker2R(datos, amb = 2, stand = TRUE, nc1 = 2, nc2 = 2, niter = 1000)
}

\arguments{
  \item{datos}{a data frame with n rows for individuals and p variable
    for columns. All the conditions must be the same variables names
    and individuals.
}
  \item{amb}{The diferent conditions, in which the same variables and
    individuals had been studied. By default is 2.
}
  \item{stand}{a boolean value, if it is TRUE (value set by default)
    each variabel is centered and scale by variable.
}
  \item{nc1}{number of components in the first mode, by default is 2
}
  \item{nc2}{number of components in the second mode, by default is 2
}
  \item{niter}{the iteration number for the Tuckals algorithm, by
    default 1000 iteration
}
}
\details{To determine the number of components that are going to be retained, we use previously to the algorithm applications, a method called DifFit. The number of components in the third mode is obtained from the number of conditions.  The labels of the variables must be the same for all conditions in the data frame.}
\value{
 \item{Resultado}{a list which stores the name of the individual and the variables, the number of iterations, the variability explained by the model, and the total variability.}
 \item{Proyeccion}{It is a list which holds the projection of individuals and variables to see if the biplot is difficult to
   understand because of  the huge number of cases or plotted vectors.}
 \item{saltuck}{is a list with the results of the algorithm to plot the biplot, where the names of the conditions are well kept.}
